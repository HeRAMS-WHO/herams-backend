# To avoid created files being owned by root (on linux) set these variables to your user id and group id.
# Note that even though in your terminal they are set, they are shell variables and not environment variables.
# Instead of configuring these here, you can also add the following to ~/.bashrc:
# export GID=$(id -g)
# export UID

#UID=1000
#GID=1000
