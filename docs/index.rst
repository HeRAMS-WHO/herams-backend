Tooltips
~~~~~~~~

If you hover with your mouse over a point on a map or a chart, a small pop-up message will appear, displaying additional details.

Adjust the Map Zoom Level and Focus Area
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can adjust the zoom level of a map by using the scroll button on your mouse. To change the focus area of a map, position you mouse in the map element. Right click (hold) and drag the map in the desired direction. This will move the map focus area.

Remove a Category from Charts or Maps
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By clicking the icons in the legend, you can remove a category from a chart or map. To add it again, simply click the circle again.

Reorder map layers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Depending on the zoom level applied to a map, it may happen that several points lie on top of each other, hiding some facilities. To bring a specific category to the front, uncheck the category in the legend. This will remove the category from the map. If you add the category again (click the now empty circle), the category will be added on top of the other points.

HeRAMS Administration
=====================

This chapter provides an overview of the admin pages in HeRAMS and offers step-by-step instructions for common tasks performed by advanced users and project administrators. The first part of the chapter introduces the concept of `Workspaces`__ while the second part focuses on `Project`__ level administration and the configuration of project specific `Dashboard`__.

 .. __: `Workspaces`_
 .. __: `Projects`_
 .. __: `Project Dashboard`_

.. note:: If you require your permissions to be changed, kindly contact your country focal point or send an email to `HeRAMS Support Team <mailto:herams@who.int?>`_ specifying your function and role as well as a brief explanation of why you would like your access permissions to altered.


Workspaces
----------

HeRAMS uses the concept of workspaces to manage user permissions. Each workspace consists of several health facilities and has a dedicated focal point responsible for updating these records. A workspace might, for example, include all MoSDs of a geographical region, MoSDs managed by a specific partner or any other logical category. Thus, the use of workspaces in combination with different levels of permissions (see below) assures granular, role-based access control to a project and the underlying data. While most users only have access to a single workspace, project administrators might have access to several or all workspaces.

* |refresh| **Refresh Data Cache**: This button allows users to manually refresh the data cache of a workspace. Data is automatically refreshed every 30 minutes. This means if a record is updated, the changes are not immediately reflected on the dashboard. Thus, by manually refreshing the data cache of a workspace the time lag limitation can be overcome and the changes made will become visible immediately.
* |pencil-thin| **Update Workspace**:  allows to change the title or token of a workspace.
* |share-icon| **Share Workspace**: To grant a user access to workspace, the workspace must be shared with the user. For more information on how to add users to a workspace click `here`__.
* |delete-black| **Delete Workspace**: Permanently removes a workspace from a project. See `Delete a Workspace`__ for more information.
* |download| **Download Data**: Downloads all records belonging to the selected workspace. See `Download Data`__ for more information.
* |pencil-black| **Data Update**: This opens the data edit interface. More information on data editing and updating is available `here`__.

.. note: The number of buttons visible to users depends on your access rights and might vary from one workspace to another.

Workspace Permissions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are two permission levels for workspaces:

1. access to manage the underlying responses’ data; and
2. full access (includes editing the workspace properties, token and responses’ data).

Users with the role of **Data Editor** have access to update the response data (option 1) while **Workspace Owners** might be given elevated permission (option 2) allowing them to add additional users to their workspace as well as to manage the underlying response data.

Add a User to a Workspace
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. To grant a user access to a workspace, open the admin interface by clicking the |settings| icon in the top right corner of the screen.
2. In the navigation pane on the left, click `Projects <https://herams.org/project/index>`_ to open the **Projects** overview table. 
3. In the rightmost column of the table, you should see several **Action** buttons. Click the |workspace| icon. This will open the workspace of the selected project.
4. You should now see a table with all workspaces of your project. For each workspace the table provides information on the last time data was synced with the underlying database, the number of contributors, health facilities and responses. Alike the **Projects** table, the last column contains several **Action** buttons.
5. To grant a user access to a workspace (e.g. to update the data), you have to share the workspace with them. Click the |share-icon| icon in the **Actions** column.
6. You should now see a page similar to the image below. On the bottom half of the page, you can see a list of all users currently having access to the workspace including their permission level. In the top half of the page, you have the option to add a new user. Start typing the user’s name in the top field. You will notice that the list of available users dynamically filters as you are typing. Select the user you would like to add.

Can't access a project dashboard
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For data protection reasons, access to the project dashboards is only granted upon request. If you require access to a project, please contact your country focal point or send an email to `hearms@who.int <mailto:herams@who.int?>`_, specifying why you require access to the project.

Who has access to your project?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In-country administrators and users responsible for a project or workspace can verify the list of users having access to the
project and/or workspace as well as their permission levels.
See `HeRAMS Administration`__ for more information on sharing `project`__ and `workspaces`__.
 
 .. __: `HeRAMS Administration`_
 .. __: `Projects`_
 .. __: `Workspaces`_


Data editing & downloading
-------------------------

Data updates don't appear on the dashboard
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is important to note that the data displayed on the interactive dashboards are only synchronized every 30 minutes. Thus, is it is possible that updates to the data don't show immediately on the dashboards. To solve the issue, manually sync the data cache of the workspace. For more information on data caching read the section on `Workspaces`__.

 .. __: `Workspaces`_
 
Exported data is unreadable / contains strange characters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you open data downloaded from HeRAMS in Excel, you might experience an issue with special characters not displaying correctly, resulting in unreadable text. For example, instead of **camp de réfugiés** you get **Camp de rÃ©fugiÃ©s**. The reason for this is that Excel is not using the correct encoding type to read your data. To correct the issue, follow the instruction outlined `here`__.
