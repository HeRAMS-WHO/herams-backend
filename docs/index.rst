Introduction
============

Welcome to the **HeRAMS User Guide**.
This user guide was designed for users of the `HeRAMS platform <https://herams.org/user/login/>`_ and aims to provide users with a brief overview of key components of the platform.
In addition, step-by-step instruction for common tasks intend to facilitate navigating the platform
It should be noted that the guide solely address issues related to the HERAMS paltfrom. For general information on the HeRAMS approach and for technical guidance please consult the `WHO HeRAMS webpage <https://www.who.int/hac/herams/en//>`_.

The first two chapters of this user guide are intended for all users and provide step-by-step instructions on how to `access the HeRAMS platform`__ as well as a brief overview on the `project dashboards`__.

.. __: `Getting started`_
.. __: `Explore Data`

`Edit Data` is intended for data editors and covers essential steps on how to access, edit and download data.
`Herams Administration` offers additional guidance for country administrators and provides detailed information related to user management, access permissions, and the configuration of the project specific interactive dashboards.

Tips
----

.. tip:: If you hover with your mouse over a point on the map or the chart, you will see a small pop-up message appearing displaying further details.

.. tip:: You can adjust the zoom level of the maps using the scroll button on your mouse. In addition, you can change the focus area of the map. Make sure your mouse is in the map element. Right click *(hold)* and drag the map in the desired direction. This will move the map focus area.

.. tip:: By clicking the icons in the legend, you can remove a category from a chart or map.  To add it again, simply click the circle again.

.. tip:: If the map is zoomed out, it might happen that several points lie on top of each other. Thus, hidding some facilities. As a result, categories with only few facilities might be hidden. To bring a specific category to the front, uncheck the category in the legend. This will remove the category from the map. If you add the category back (click the now empty circle), the category will be added on top of the other points.

Default pages
-------------

The below section provides an overview of the standard pages available in a dashboard. Each page refers to a HeRAMS standard information pillar.

.. note:: The order and the content of dashboards is customized based on the needs for individual projects. Your dashboard might therefore be substantially different from the example pages displayed below.

Overview
~~~~~~~~

The **Overview** page provides a summary, in form of:
-  A map to spot the distribution and number of health facilities by level of care (i.e. primary, secondary and tertiary health care facilities); and
-  Doughnut  charts to summarize different indicators, such as level of damage, functionality status, accessibility and service availability in the assessed health facility.

.. note:: Service availability is country specific. Thus, direct comparisons form one country to another should be avoided.

.. image:: media/img/HeRAMS_dashboard_overview.png
   :height: 300px

Infrastructure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The **Infrastructure** page, displays a descriptive analysis, including:
- a map to spot the distribution and number of health facilities by type;

HeRAMS Administration
=====================

This chapter aims to provide an overview of the admin pages in HeRAMS and provides step-by-step instruction for common tasks performed by advanced users and country administrators.
The first part of the chapter introduces the concept of [Workspaces](#workspaces) while the second part focuses on [Project](#projects) level administration as well as the configuration of project specific [Dashboards](#configure-the-project-dashboard).

<p align="center">
	<img src="media/img/icon_info.png" height="20" align="top" alt='info'></img>
	<i> Access to each of the sub-sections of this chapter are depending on the tasks a user is expected to complete. If you require your permissions to be changed, please contact your system administrator.</i>
</p>

Workspaces
----------

HeRAMS uses the concept of workspaces to manage user permissions. Each workspace consists of several health facilities and has a dedicated focal point responsible for updating these records.
A workspace might for example include all health facilities of a geographical region, health facilities managed by a specific partner or any other logical categories.
Thus, the use of workspaces in combination with different levels of permission (see below) assures granular, role-based access control to a project and the underlying data.
While most users only have access to a single workspace, country administrators might have access to several or all workspaces.

- <img src="media/img/icon_refresh_data.png" height="20" align="top" alt='refresh'></img> **Data Refresh**: This button allows users to manually refresh the data cache of a workspace. Data is automatically refreshed every 30 minutes. This means if a record is updated, the changes are not immediately reflected on the dashboard.
Thus, by manually refreshing the data cash of a workspace the time lack limitation can be overcome and the changes made will be visible immediately.
- <img src="media/img/icon_pencil_black.png" height="20" align="top" alt='edit'></img> **Update Workspace**: allows to change the title or token of a workspace.
- <img src="media/img/icon_share.png" height="20" align="top" alt='share'></img> **Share Workspace**: To grant a user access to workspace, the workspace must be shared with the user. For more information on how to add users to a workspace click [here](#add-a-user-to-a-workspace).
- <img src="media/img/icon_delete_black.png" height="20" align="top" alt='delete'></img> **Delete Workspace** See [Delete Workspaces](#delete-workspaces) for further information
- <img src="media/img/icon_download.png" height="20" align="top" alt='download'></img> **Download Data**: Downloads all data associated with the workspace. See [data download](#download-data) for more information.
- <img src="media/img/icon_data_update_black.png" height="20" align="top" alt='edit data'></img> **Data Update**: This opens the data edit interface. More information on data editing and updating is available in the [previous chapter](#edit-data).


  .. note: The number of buttons visible to you depends on your access rights and might vary from one workspace to another.

#### Workspace Permissions

There are two permission levels for workspaces.

1. Manage the underlying response data.
2. Full access, includes editing the workspace properties, token and response data.

Users with the role of **Data Editor** have access to update the response data (option 1) while **Workspace Owners** might be given elevated permission (option 2) allowing them to add additional users to their workspace and to manage the underlying response data

#### Add a User to a Workspace

1. To grant a user access to a workspace, open the admin interface by clicking the <img src="media/img/icon_settings.png" height="20" align="top" alt='settings'></img> icon in the top right corner of the screen.
2. In the navigation pane on the left, click [Projects](https://herams.org/project/index) to open the **Projects** table (see [Projects](#projects) for more information).
3. In the rightmost column of the table, you should see several **Action** buttons. Click the <img src="media/img/icon_workspace.png" height="20" align="top" alt='workspace'></img>  icon. This will open the workspace of the selected project.
4. You should now see a table with all workspaces of your project. For each workspace the table provides information on the last time data was synced with the underlying database, the number of contributors, health facilities and responses. Alike the **Projects** table, the last column contains several **Action** buttons.
5. To grant a user access to a workspace (e.g. to update the data), you have to share the workspace with them. Click the <img src="media/img/icon_share.png" height="20" align="top" alt='share'></img> icon in the *Actions* column.
