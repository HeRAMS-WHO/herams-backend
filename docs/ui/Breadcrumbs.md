# Breadcrumbs

Breadcrumbs are a navigational aid, they have the following goals:

- Positioning, gives the user an idea of where he is on the site
- Navigation, gives the user a quick way to navigate up the navigation tree

## Positioning

For breadcrumbs to be useful in deciding where you are they have some requirements:

- Must start at a navigation root
- Must end with a (local) identifier for the current page
- Must show all steps in between OR indicate some steps are hidden using some visual marker

## Navigation

All links excepts the one to the current page should be usable for navigation
