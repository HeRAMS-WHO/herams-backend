# HF Layer roadmap

## Milestone: end of 2021

### Features
- Create surveys in SurveyJS
- Start new projects with SurveyJS instead of Limesurvey
- All flows work with both project types (including dashboards)

### Important notes
- Limesurvey projects remain the same way they were
- Updating a Survey will create a new Survey and once a survey is in a project it cannot be updated

## Backlog
- Transition a project from Limesurvey to SurveyJS
- Update flow of a Survey in a project
- Pause Facility
- Review all permissions on all steps, maybe even redo all permissions?

## After Limesurvey deprecation
- Redo dashboarding
